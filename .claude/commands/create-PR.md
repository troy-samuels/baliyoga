Create a PR against this branch: $ARGUMENTS.

Follow these steps:

1. ALWAYS start by running `git status` to check what branch you're on
2. Use this template: `gh pr create --base dev --head david --title "very clear & concise title" --body "clear, detailed description of changes"`
3. Always create Pull Requests against the branch the user specifies (or default to 'dev' branch). NEVER EVER AGAINST 'main'
4. If you run into issues, STOP and explain the error to the user.

Remember:
- Use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all GitHub-related tasks
- Make titles clear & concise, and descriptions detailed yet focused
- DO NOT credit yourself
- for fixes, prefix the title with "FIX: "
- for large & risky changes, prefix the title with "RISKY: "

<example>

- `gh pr create --base dev --head david --title "FIX: clear & concise title" --body "clear, detailed description of changes"`
